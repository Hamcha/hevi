hevi
====

hevi is a light framework for writing websites and applications

### What's so special about it? ###

There's no magic in hevi, it just makes writing websites and web application a little easier, using XML in a "template engine"-like way.  
It also includes Markdown which makes writing of markup text even more confortable.

hevi's key feature is flexibility: you can develop everything just the way you always did but in a more scalable and easy way.

If you're still interested in developing from scratch, check out the [barebones version](https://github.com/Hamcha/hevi/tree/master/barebones) of the framework.

### Versions ###

#### Barebones ####

hevi/barebones is the purest version of hevi, it only contains the XML Parser and Markdown library (which was made by [Michel Fortin](http://michelf.com).)

#### Devaid (Planned) ####

hevi/devaid is a custom version of hevi based on [hamcha.net](http://hamcha.net), it includes everything you can already find in the **barebones** version but also includes things like OAuth authentication (Twitter/Google+) and pre-made "blocks".

#### Metro (Planned) ####

hevi/metro is a custom theme based on the metro look in [hamcha.net](http://hamcha.net).
